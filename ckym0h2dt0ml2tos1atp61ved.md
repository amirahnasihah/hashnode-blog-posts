### Apa Khabar?ðŸ‘€

I grew up in Malaysia, surrounded by the vibrant culture and bustling cities of Southeast Asia. From a young age, I was always fascinated by technology and the incredible things it could do.

Despite my love for technology, I pursued a degree in accounting, which provided a solid foundation in business and finance. But my passion for tech never wavered, and I eventually found my way into the tech industry.

In my early year as a tech enthusiast, I explored the various tools and technologies used by developers, and I was amazed by the power and potential of the tech community. I quickly became a passionate advocate for the use of technology to improve people's lives, and I started sharing my knowledge and experiences with others through my blog and social media.

> "<mark>Apa khabar</mark>" is a common greeting in Malay, which is spoken in Malaysia, Indonesia, and other Southeast Asian countries. It literally translates to "what news?" and is used as a way of asking someone how they are doing or what's new with them. It is similar to saying "how are you?" in English.
