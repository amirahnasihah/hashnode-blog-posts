To become proficient at creating AI art, you must first learn how prompts work. What you ask the AI art generator to produce is prompt. Lexica is a website similar to Google that displays AI art as well as the prompts used to produce it. It's a great way to find prompts for your own ideas.

### 2️⃣ Artbreeder

DALL-E is an artificial intelligence program that dazzles with its capacity to transform the text into lifelike pictures. You get 50 free credits for the first month and 15 free credits after that.

### 5️⃣ Midjourney

They use the Discord server to generate an image using AI. Midjourney allows you to create your first 25 photos for free. But you won't be able to stop at 25! offering a basic membership with a monthly subscription and a higher-level standard membership that allows you to generate unlimited images.

### 6️⃣ Stable Diffusion web demo

Try out the Stable Diffusion online demo above. It functions similarly to Stable Diffusion, but with less adjustability and lower-quality pictures. Since you can make an infinite number of photos, it's fun to experiment with different prompts.

### 7️⃣ Installing and using Stable Diffusion

Installing and running Stable Diffusion on your own machine provides you with the most control and flexibility when creating AI art. You can generate an endless number of images and use custom models and features like Initial Image (img2img). It provides a lot of features and options that can be very helpful for users.
