# ReactJS - Introduction

# What is ReactJS?

➡️declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building reusable UI components.

➡️an open-source, component-based front-end library responsible only for the view layer of the application.

➡️created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook.

➡️ was initially developed and maintained by Facebook and later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram before it was released to the public in the month of May 2013.

➡️In MVC (model view controller) architecture, React is the 'V' which stands for view, whereas the architecture is provided by Redux or Flux.

# How ReactJS Works

💥A ReactJS application is made up of multiple components, each component responsible for outputting a small, reusable piece of HTML code.

💥These Components can be nested with other components to allow complex applications to be built of simple building blocks.

💥ReactJS uses a virtual DOM-based mechanism to fill data in HTML DOM.

💥The virtual DOM works fast as it only changes individual DOM elements instead of reloading the complete DOM every time.
