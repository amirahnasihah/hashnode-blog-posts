Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ It's been a year since I last shared my thoughts on Hashnode, and a lot has happened in my career journey in 2023. Let me walk you through my journey from accounting to front-end development â€” the downs and ups!

To give you some background, I completed a degree in accountancy. During my final semester, I came across the word "programming" during a group project. Excited by the potential, I began a self-guided path to learn programming. Little did I know, this would mark the start of a significant career change in my life.

# Diversifying Skills

My initial opportunity in the real-world tech industry was as a System Engineering Intern at an AI startup while enrolled in TalentLabs' intermediate-level Front End Development training program. During the program, **I didn't just stick to the coursework**. I explored AI Midjourney for image creation and even applied for an internship in the tech industry. I learned a lot about software development, artificial intelligence (AI), quality assurance (QA) testing, UI/UX feedback, and even copywriting, all of which became part of my daily tasks. LinkedIn became my platform for copywriting, and my posts received a staggering 476% increase in impressions. Balancing internship responsibilities with front-end development projects was difficult, but the experience proved invaluable.

# **Continuous Learning**

Post-internship, I focused on completing my front-end development course, building projects like the News Search App. The next phase was job hunting which led me to the build of [**my portfolio website**](https://amirahnasihah.vercel.app/) with ReactJS and Tailwind CSS. This **portfolio aims to show my projects and writings**. So, I studied Tailwind CSS for UI and GraphQL to integrate with the Hashnode API.

Then there was one concern â€” my project database which I had hardcoded in JSON format. This led me to sign up for the TalentLabs Beta Program, Back-End with ExpressJS and MySQL, where I learned how to manage project databases efficiently. This completes my skill set.

# My Portfolio Website

Surprisingly, my portfolio drew the attention of multiple recruiters. **A year later, I snagged my dream job as a Front End Developer**, proving that the effort put into my portfolio and public contributions paid off.

Reflecting on this experience, I've realized the value of showing one's skills and sharing knowledge with the community.

## Top 10 Malaysian GitHub Users By Public Contributions

One unexpected recognition came my way when friends mentioned I made it to the <mark>Top 10 GitHub Users By Public Contributions in Malaysia</mark>. I made public repositories on GitHub for all of my courses and projects to contribute to the learning experiences of others.

This acknowledgement is more than simply a personal accomplishment; it proves the power of sharing and learning in the digital community.
