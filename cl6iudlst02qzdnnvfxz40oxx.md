# buildspace web3 demo showcase!

Last night's [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/projects) demo day was a blast, as was go-karting around the map on gather.town dressed as a pumpkin. It's a massive web3 display!

Over 150 fantastic web3 makers from the buildspace ecosystem and are giving them a shot to showcase what they've shipped. Got people building in GameFi, dev tools, education, social, and much more.

buildspace N&W Demo Day happened on Saturday, August 6 at 11:00 PM Malaysia Time or August 6 at 11:00 AM ET. They had more than 500 people running around the demo map within that 4 hours.

This was my second time attending a buildspace demo day, also explored a lot of crazy projects and met some fantastic people.

[Rubix ](http://rubix.bunsamosa.org), [WaitlistPanda](https://www.waitlistpanda.com/), and [pipgig](https://pipgig.com/signin) piqued my interest. Also, listen to and chat with them!
